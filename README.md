# CovidAnalysis
Data analysis using various ready-to-use COVID-19 databases to derive vital information for deriving socio-economic, cultural, 
and environmental benefits
This project is at the preliminary stage where emphasis is laid on simple data visualisations of COVID-19 epidemic and spread from
a couple of popular COVID-19 databases. The aim, however, is to conduct, share, and promote a more responsible data visualisation in a
very sensitive case of a pandemic. Let us inform people and authorities to aid in their knowledge, understanding, decision making
and well-being, rather than incite fear and panic amongst the masses.

The database comprises of two files:
1. "Cases.csv" --> Derives from John Hopkins University COVID-19 database
2. "Database2.csv" --> Derives from Oxford University Government Response Tracker

All the visualisations are performed in the R script file --> "Data_Visualisation_Covid.R"
PLEASE NOTE: This database is not an updated one (data till 18th April 2020). So any results obtained will be limited to that time frame.
